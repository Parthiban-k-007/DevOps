# DevOps Project – CI/CD Pipeline & Infrastructure Automation

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end DevOps setup that automates the build, test, deployment, and monitoring process for modern applications.  
The goal is to ensure **fast delivery**, **high availability**, and **scalability** with minimal manual intervention.

## 🚀 Features
- **CI/CD Pipeline** using GitHub Actions / Jenkins
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform / Ansible
- **Containerization** with Docker
- **Orchestration** using Kubernetes
- **Monitoring & Logging** with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack
- **Cloud Integration** (AWS, Azure, or GCP)

## 🏗️ Architecture
The pipeline ensures:
1. **Continuous Integration (CI)** – Merges are tested automatically.
2. **Continuous Delivery (CD)** – Deployments are automated to staging/production.
3. **Observability** – Metrics, logs, and alerts are collected.


## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **CI/CD Tools**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Ansible
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
